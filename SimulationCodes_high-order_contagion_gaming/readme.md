**BigNetVerification** evaluate IPS on a large-scale real-world hypergraph.

**Compare_groundTruth** Figure 1 a-e

**Robust_NonlinearModel** evaluate IPS under HCP (robustness and IPS_2, Fig.4)

**Robust_HNCSizeModel** evaluate IPS under HCSA (transferability, Fig.5)

**Robust_ThresholdModel** evaluate IPS under HTC (transferability, Fig.5)

`simu_HNContagion_SIR.py`, `simu_naming_game.py`, `Hsimulation_utils.py` : see readme.md in `../SimulationResults`, corresponding to HCP in Fig.2 and 3, and HNG in Fig.6.
